# Group 9 CommLab Final Project : Simulation of Arbitrated Quantum Signature Protocols

Group 9 Communication Lab Final Project
## Introduction 

The two files contain simulations for two AQS schemes. One uses the chained CNOT encryption method [[1]](#1) while the other applies quantum one time pad encryption[[2]](#2). The schemes are based on the referenced papers. 

## General

For both protocols, Alice acts as the signatory, Bob as the receiver and Trent as the arbitrator. The protocols can be divided into 4 phases each : 

* **Initializing Phase** : Prepares and distributes QKD keys **K_AT, K_BT** and Entangled Bell states for Alice and Bob. Alice generates message **P**. Usually more than one copy of the message will be created. 

* **Signing Phase** : Alice creates her signature using encryption methods(chained CNOT or QOTP). Alice also performs bell measurement on her message bit and her entangled Bell State.

* **Verification Phase** : Bob will verify the authenticity of Alice's signature with Trent's assistance. With Alice's bell state measurement results, Bob can get Alice's message through calculation.

* **Dispute Resolving Phase** : When a dispute occurs between Alice and Bob, Bob will have to send the signature, message pair to Trent for dispute handling.

## Encryption Methods

* **QOTP Encryption** : QOTP encryption method applies Pauli-x to a qubit when key[2\*i] = 1, and Pauli-z when key[2\*i+1] = 1. ![alt text](images/qotp.png?raw=true)

* **Chained-CNOT Encryption** : Chained-CNOT encryption encrypts creates n/2 pairs of control-target pairs based on the encryption key using the CNOT gate. ![alt text](images/chained_cnot_encryption.png?raw=true)



## State Comparison

* **SWAP test** : multiple qubit SWAP test is used for state comparison. This allows us to check if 2 multiple qubits states are identical or not. Each test requires one ancilla bit.![alt text](images/swaptest.png?raw=true)


## Security Test

To discriminate the security risk between using QOTP encryption and Chained-CNOT encryption, we chose Bob's forgery attack[[3]](#3). Since Bob already has a (P, S) pair from Alice, this is called a known message attack. 

Results show that with the chained-CNOT encryption method, Bob's forgery will not pass Trent's dispute handling. On the other hand, Bob can easily perform known message attack on QOTP encryption schemes.
